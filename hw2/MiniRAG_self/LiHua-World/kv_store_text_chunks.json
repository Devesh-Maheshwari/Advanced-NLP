You can mix them into your training days for a boost or do them on your off days for active recovery. Just listen to your body!

It’s so frustrating trying to keep up with their whims! Can’t they just stick to something for once?\nWolfgangSchulz: Seriously, that's the worst! It's like they're never satisfied. 😅 Just keep a clear log of all the changes they request. It might help you track what you’ve done and see if you can push back a bit on the constant changes.\nLiHua: Great idea! I'll start keeping a log of all their requests. Just really hope they settle on something soon. It's making it hard to focus on my other projects. 😩 Any plans for today?\nWolfgangSchulz: Yeah, I hear you. It's tough when clients are all over the place! As for today, I'm just chilling and probably diving into some coding later. Thinking of experimenting with a new music app too. What about you? Any fun plans?\nLiHua: I might go for a little walk and see if I can find a new café to check out. Need a break to clear my head! ☕️ Plus, who knows, maybe I’ll snap some cool photos along the way! 📸 How's the coding going, by the way? \nWolfgangSchulz: A walk sounds perfect! Fresh air always helps. 🥲 Coding's been pretty smooth lately, actually. Just trying to fine-tune some functions for that new project I'm working on. Got any specific vibes you're looking for in that café? \nLiHua: Just something chill and cozy, maybe with good coffee and some nice vibes! A place where I can relax for a bit and maybe get some work done too. I love those kinds of spots! What about you? Any favorite cafes you’d recommend?\nWolfgangSchulz: There's a great little café not far from here called \"The Java Spot.\" Super cozy, free Wi-Fi, and they have awesome coffee! Plus, they play nice background music, which is perfect for focusing. You'll love it! Let me know if you check it out!\nLiHua: Thanks for the tip! I’ll definitely swing by \"The Java Spot\" later. Sounds like the perfect spot to chill and work! 🙌 Enjoy your coding session!",

I'm loving the variety so far, but I feel like I need a bit more protein for my workouts. Could we adjust that? Also, maybe a few more snack options? Thanks!\nJenniferMoore: Awesome to hear you’re enjoying it! Let's definitely boost that protein. How about we add some lean meats or protein-rich snacks? I can suggest some options for you too.
